<center> <p>Wakanda is located in East Africa,<br> although its exact location has varied throughout the nation's publication history,<br> 
   some sources place Wakanda just north of Tanzania,<br> while others – such as Marvel Atlas #2[4] – show it at the north end of Lake Turkana,<br> in between South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia<br>
    (and surrounded by fictional countries like Azania, Canaan, and Narobia).<br> In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (The Black Panther),<br>
    on-screen maps use the location given in Marvel Atlas #2.<br> In recent stories by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, Wakanda is located on Lake Victoria,<br> near Mohannda, Canaan, Azania and Niganda.<br> This places these nations mostly in what in real life is the eastern half of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br>
In the 2018 film Black Panther, director stated that his depiction of Wakanda<br> was inspired by the Southern African Kingdom of Lesotho.</p></center>
